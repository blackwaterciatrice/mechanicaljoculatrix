# mechanicaljoculatrix
This is a discord bot that runs in a cloud server, using occasional pings from a third-party service to keep the server active; while active, the bot will make a few off-color comments and, when asked to tell you a joke, will either tell you a joke (pulled from an API) or quote you the current price of bitcoin in USD (pulled from an API).
